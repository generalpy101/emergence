# Investment Thesis — "The SMB Back-Office Unlock"

> Version 1 (draft). This file *is* the scoring bar: the pipeline's rubric, gates, and
> call bands are defined here, and changes to them are git history.

## What we fund

Seed-stage B2B software companies that automate **concrete, expensive, currently-manual
workflows for small and mid-sized businesses** (roughly 1–500 employees), built by
**small technical teams**, with evidence of **bottom-up pull** rather than pure
enterprise top-down sales.

Why this, why now:

- SMBs run on spreadsheets, email, and part-time bookkeepers because horizontal SaaS
  never fit vertical-specific workflows, and custom software was never economical at
  SMB price points. LLM-based automation collapses that cost curve — workflows that
  needed a $500k implementation now need a prompt and an integration.
- SMB software has historically churned heavily; we weight **evidence that customers
  actually use the thing** (launch traction, community pull, OSS adoption) over
  pipeline promises.

## What we do not fund (hard gates)

Any one of these forces a **Pass** regardless of score:

- Consumer social, crypto/web3, hardware-heavy, or pure services/agency businesses.
- No identifiable product (dead site, placeholder page, waiting list only).
- No findable team — if we cannot tell who is building this, we cannot underwrite them.

## Scoring rubric (0–100)

The LLM scores each dimension **0–5 against the anchors below**, citing a source URL
for every claim. Code maps subscores to weights: `score = Σ weight × (subscore / 5)`.

### Team — 25

- **5** Technical founders with directly relevant domain or startup experience;
  evidence of prior shipping (OSS, prior startups, exits).
- **3** Technical founder(s), plausible background, limited public track record.
- **1** Team unverifiable or solo non-technical founder with no product evidence.

### Product — 20

- **5** Working product a stranger can understand in one sentence; clearly automates a
  named workflow; differentiated from obvious alternatives.
- **3** Real product, fuzzy positioning or crowded space with some wedge.
- **1** Vaporware, demo-only, or "AI wrapper" with no workflow depth.

### Market & why-now — 20

- **5** Large, identifiable SMB segment with a painful, budgeted workflow; a credible
  why-now (capability shift, regulation, platform change); visible whitespace.
- **3** Real market but timing argument is generic ("AI is hot"), or segment unclear.
- **1** Niche too small, or incumbents already own the workflow end-to-end.

### Traction & freshness — 20

- **5** Launched ≤6 months ago with strong third-party signal (front-page HN traction,
  active OSS repo with external contributors, named customers).
- **3** Recent launch, modest but real engagement.
- **1** Stale (>18 months with no recent signal) or zero observable traction.

### Thesis fit — 15

- **5** Squarely in thesis: B2B, SMB buyer, manual-workflow automation, bottom-up motion.
- **3** Adjacent: right motion, wrong segment (or vice versa) with a credible path.
  **Tooling whose buyer is the AI developer — agent frameworks, agent infra,
  dev tooling — is adjacent, not core: thesis_fit ≤ 3 and category
  `b2b_other`, unless evidence shows a non-developer SMB buyer.**
- **1** Outside thesis but not gated out.

## Call bands

| Score | Call |
|---|---|
| ≥ 70 | **Take a meeting** |
| 50–69 | **Watch** |
| < 50, or any gate triggered | **Pass** |

## What good evidence looks like

- HN thread with founders actively answering questions.
- Team page with named people and verifiable histories (OSS, prior companies).
- Public GitHub org with recent commits and external stars/issues.
- Customers or design partners named anywhere public.

## Known failure modes of this thesis (honesty section)

- Bottom-up SMB pull can mask churn; a Watch call should name what retention evidence
  would resolve it.
- "AI agents for X" is 2025's most crowded claim; the Product dimension must
  distinguish workflow depth from prompt-wrapping, or scores will inflate.
